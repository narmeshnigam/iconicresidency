# Iconic Residency Website

This repository contains a simple static website for the Iconic Residency project. The home page is `index.html` and additional pages like `about.html`, `contact.html`, `pricing.html` etc. provide detailed information. All pages share a common header and footer styled via `main.css`.

The `assets/` directory stores images and icons used throughout the site. These files are provided here as placeholders only â€“ you should replace them with the real images in your deployment.

Open `index.html` or any other page in a modern browser to view the site.
